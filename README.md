# Adversarial Attacks

Implementations for several white-box and black-box attacks, including: FGSM attack, PGD attack, CW attack and ZOO attack. Before running the codes, make sure that ```PreActResNet18.py``` and ```CIFAR10_PreActResNet18.checkpoint``` are in the same folder.

```Experiment Report.pdf``` is the experiment report of my homework.
